Homebrew formulae for my devel needs.

Installation
------------

1. Install [Homebrew]
2. Tap this repository ```brew tap fxbois/fxbois```

After this, formulae can be used to install software using the standard ```brew``` command.
For example, to install php

```

```

This will install ```php``` and all its dependencies.
